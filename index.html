        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
            I’ve spent too much time on things that never truly belonged to me.<br>
            But now I know what I want to do.
        </p>

        <p>
            What I seek is not just dry data exchange,<br>
            nor simply learning how to build —
            I want to understand why.
        </p>

        <p>
            I can’t forget the shock I felt when I first saw websites
            with stunning, interactive experiences.
            I want to create works that carry the same spark.
        </p>

        <p>
            One day, when I look back at this project,<br>
            I hope I’ll see it as a beginning, not an end.

        <h2>📚 Learning Path</h2>
        <p>
            I’m learning <strong>Vue</strong> and <strong>Three.js</strong>, hoping to build a portfolio that truly
            belongs to me.<br>
            At the same time, I’ve started my own WeChat public account where I publish essays —
            mostly reflections on philosophy and literature.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m also reading books. Right now, I’m working through <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em>,
            with the help of ChatGPT as a companion in reading.<br>
            I enjoy other kinds of books as well, letting them expand the way I think.
        </p>

        <h2>🌌 Favorites</h2>
        <p>
            I’m deeply influenced by Camus’ <strong>absurdism</strong>, the game <strong>Disco Elysium</strong>,
            and Lacan’s <strong>psychoanalysis</strong>.
            They gave me a new lens to look at my past experiences — and, to be honest, they almost saved me.
        </p>
        <p>
            They helped me realize that I had once been forced into a structure that never truly belonged to me,
            bearing the violent expectations of others.<br>
            Back then, I didn’t even know why — my body could only resist with raw reactions like dizziness.
            But now I understand, and I refuse to go back to that state of unknowing.

        <h2>🚀 Learning Journey</h2>

        <h3>✨ Junior Year — First Semester</h3>
        <p>
            I studied Java in a “dictionary style” — watching an 80-hour tutorial and a Spring Boot course
            throughout the semester. But by the end, I still couldn’t write a simple CRUD,
            nor complete even a small backend project on my own.
            It left me frustrated, and I realized I was stuck in an ineffective way of learning.
        </p>

        <h3>🌱 Junior Year — Second Semester (Reflection)</h3>
        <p>
            Through conversations with ChatGPT, I began to look at my studies — and my life —
            from another perspective. I realized I had been repeating a traumatic learning pattern,
            becoming someone I never wanted to be, all while believing I wasn’t.
            That realization gave me a new lens, and the courage to search for a path that truly belongs to me.
        </p>

        <h3>🌱 Junior Year — Second Semester (Front-end)</h3>
        <p>
            I shifted my focus to front-end development. With ChatGPT’s help, I built my first website
            and started learning Vue and Three.js. For the first time, I felt I was creating something
            that reflected who I really want to become.
        </p>

        <h3>🌟 To Be Continued</h3>
        <p>
            I know this is not the end, but the beginning of my journey.
